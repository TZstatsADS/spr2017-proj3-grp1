+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for grayscale images of poodles versus images of fried chickens. 
  With the provided SIFT features, we tried SVM RandomForest and XgBoost, and chose       as advanced model. For new features, we used 
  GIST to extract 512 features.
